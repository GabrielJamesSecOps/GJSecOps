  <h1>When Hackers Hold Your Code Hostage</h1>

  <p>In the startup world, speed often beats structure. But when ransomware hits, it can bring everything to a halt — fast.</p>

  <h2>What Is Ransomware?</h2>
  <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts your files and locks you out of your systems. Attackers demand a ransom — often in cryptocurrency — to give you the decryption key. It's extortion, plain and simple.</p>

  <h2>Why Startups Are Prime Targets</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Minimal security budget:</strong> Most startups don't have dedicated security staff or tools in place.</li>
    <li><strong>Misconfigured cloud:</strong> Fast deployment often skips critical cloud hardening steps.</li>
    <li><strong>Weak backup strategies:</strong> Many startups rely on single-location backups, or none at all.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Fallout of an Attack</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Days to weeks of downtime</li>
    <li>Loss of user trust and client data</li>
    <li>Public reputation damage</li>
    <li>Possible legal and compliance issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Defend Against It</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Backups:</strong> Regular, offsite, and ideally immutable backups are non-negotiable.</li>
    <li><strong>Endpoint protection:</strong> Use EDR solutions with behavioral detection capabilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Access control:</strong> Apply least privilege and strong MFA everywhere — including production infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>Incident planning:</strong> Run tabletop exercises so your team isn’t reacting to an attack for the first time during a crisis.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Prevention costs a fraction of what recovery does — and it's far less chaotic.</p>
