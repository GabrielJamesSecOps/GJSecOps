  <h1>Corporate Espionage in Tech: Yes, Startups Are Targets Too</h1>

  <p>When people think of espionage, they picture spy movies or big corporations. But in reality, small and mid-stage startups are increasingly being targeted for information theft — from both external and internal actors.</p>

  <h2>Why Would Anyone Target a Startup?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Valuable IP:</strong> Startups often house proprietary algorithms, designs, or data pipelines that competitors want.</li>
    <li><strong>Weak controls:</strong> Fast growth usually means lax access control and poor monitoring.</li>
    <li><strong>External partnerships:</strong> Vendors, advisors, or even early investors can pose data risks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Engineers quietly cloning repositories before joining rival teams</li>
    <li>Strategic data leaks before funding rounds or acquisitions</li>
    <li>Exfiltration of customer lists, codebases, or roadmaps by trusted insiders</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Makes Espionage So Dangerous?</h2>
  <p>Most espionage activity isn’t discovered until it’s too late — or never at all. It may not trigger alarms. Your data could be in a competitor’s hands before you know it.</p>

  <h2>How to Prevent It</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access control:</strong> Apply the principle of least privilege. Developers don’t need full prod and marketing data.</li>
    <li><strong>Activity monitoring:</strong> Watch for unusual repo cloning, large downloads, and odd access patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Exit process audits:</strong> Always audit user accounts and cloud access when someone leaves — especially technical staff or founders.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal boundaries:</strong> Use tight NDAs, contributor agreements, and monitor high-risk departments like data science and product strategy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You don't have to be a billion-dollar unicorn to be worth stealing from. If you’re building something innovative, you're a target.</p>
