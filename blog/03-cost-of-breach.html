  <h1>The Real Cost of a Breach: Why Prevention is Always Cheaper</h1>

  <p>Think cybersecurity is too expensive? Try explaining a breach to your investors, customers, and legal team. The cost of cleanup — financial, reputational, and emotional — far outweighs the cost of basic prevention.</p>

  <h2>What Gets Hit When You Get Breached?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Clients leave. New ones hesitate. Investors stall.</li>
    <li><strong>Reputation:</strong> Your brand becomes “the one that leaked data.”</li>
    <li><strong>Product velocity:</strong> Your engineers are pulled into damage control, audits, and forensics for weeks.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal risk:</strong> If you handle PII or financial data, lawsuits and fines follow.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Does Cleanup Actually Cost?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>💸 $10K–50K on IR consultants and PR crisis management</li>
    <li>⏳ 1–3 weeks of frozen product development</li>
    <li>📉 Up to 30% churn in paying users (or worse)</li>
    <li⚖️ Legal settlements, especially with customer data leaks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Much Would It Have Cost to Prevent?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ $1K–3K/month for a basic SIEM and alerting</li>
    <li>✅ $2K for a one-time penetration test</li>
    <li>✅ $0 for well-written access control policies and secure code practices</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security Is an Investment, Not a Tax</h2>
  <p>You insure your office. You insure your laptops. You budget for customer support and payroll. Budgeting for security is no different — except that it protects every other thing you're building.</p>

  <p><strong>The best time to prepare for a breach is before it happens.</strong></p>
