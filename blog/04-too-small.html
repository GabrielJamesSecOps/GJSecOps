  <h1>The Startup Myth: “We’re Too Small to Get Hacked”</h1>

  <p>If I had a dollar for every time I heard this in a kickoff call, I’d be richer than most seed-funded CTOs. The truth? Hackers don’t care how small you are — they care how easy you are to exploit.</p>

  <h2>Why Small Companies Get Hit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Misconfigured clouds:</strong> Startups move fast and often skip hardening AWS, GCP, or Azure accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>Open ports:</strong> Exposed dev servers, staging environments, and admin dashboards often go unprotected.</li>
    <li><strong>No monitoring:</strong> No alerting = no visibility = easy pickings.</li>
    <li><strong>Juicy access:</strong> Even small companies use Stripe, Slack, GitHub, and AWS — all attractive attack targets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Small Doesn’t Mean Invisible</h2>
  <p>Startups appear on open source dependency graphs, GitHub activity, press coverage, or even team members’ social profiles. Automated bots crawl all of this. You’re not hiding — you’re just unprepared.</p>

  <h2>Low Effort Defenses That Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Lock down cloud permissions with IAM roles and least privilege</li>
    <li>✅ Enable 2FA/MFA on all accounts (and enforce it)</li>
    <li>✅ Patch fast — attackers scan for known CVEs within hours</li>
    <li>✅ Use read-only access for CI/CD and automation tokens</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Being small doesn’t make you safe. It makes you soft — unless you secure smart.</strong></p>
