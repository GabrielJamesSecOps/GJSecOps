  <h1>Inside Job: Why Insider Threats Are Your Biggest Risk</h1>

  <p>Most companies worry about external hackers. But the most dangerous threats often come from the inside — people who already have access, already know the systems, and know exactly what’s valuable.</p>

  <h2>Types of Insider Threats</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Disgruntled employees:</strong> People exiting the company who want to steal data, sabotage systems, or just vent their frustration.</li>
    <li><strong>Over-permissioned staff:</strong> Team members who can access more than they need — sometimes without knowing it.</li>
    <li><strong>Unintentional insiders:</strong> Well-meaning staff who fall for phishing, reuse passwords, or upload code to public repos.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Startups Are Vulnerable</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No user access reviews or automated revocation</li>
    <li>Shared admin credentials or stale service accounts</li>
    <li>Rapid onboarding without formal training</li>
    <li>Inconsistent offboarding procedures</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prevention Tactics That Actually Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Automate de-provisioning when people leave</li>
    <li>✅ Use role-based access control (RBAC)</li>
    <li>✅ Monitor download behavior and permission changes</li>
    <li>✅ Audit internal logs — not just external ones</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Trust is good. Verification is better. Monitoring is best.</strong> Don’t wait for a former engineer to leak your entire repo.</p>
