  <h1>The First 5 Security Hires You Actually Need</h1>

  <p>Security is often deprioritized in early startup hiring plans. But waiting until Series C to hire security is like waiting until your engine explodes to get an oil change.</p>

  <h2>Here’s Who You Actually Need (and When)</h2>

  <h3>1. Security-minded DevOps (Day 1–Series A)</h3>
  <p>Your infra person should understand IAM, secrets management, and logging from the start. They don’t need the title “security engineer” — but they need the mindset.</p>

  <h3>2. GRC Consultant or vCISO (Seed–Series A)</h3>
  <p>Need help with SOC 2, ISO 27001, or working with enterprise clients? Hire someone fractional who’s done it before. Saves you months of risk down the line.</p>

  <h3>3. Security Engineer (Series A–B)</h3>
  <p>Your first full-time hire. They should own code scanning, secrets detection, internal tooling, and security automation. Look for someone who knows how to integrate with engineering — not block it.</p>

  <h3>4. Detection Engineer (Series B+)</h3>
  <p>Once you have logs, you need someone to make sense of them. This person builds alerts, refines signals, and reduces noise for the team — before alerts become alarms.</p>

  <h3>5. Governance Lead (Series C)</h3>
  <p>This role scales compliance, policy, and vendor risk — and takes that burden off your legal and product teams.</p>

  <h2>Security Isn’t One Role — It’s a Timeline</h2>
  <p>You don’t need a SOC team on Day 1. But you do need a plan. Build with security in mind early, and you’ll scale faster — and safer.</p>
