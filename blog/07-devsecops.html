  <h1>DevSecOps Isn’t Optional Anymore</h1>

  <p>Security used to be an afterthought — something you slapped on after the MVP shipped. Today, that mindset will get you breached, audited, or blocked by enterprise buyers.</p>

  <h2>What Is DevSecOps?</h2>
  <p>DevSecOps is the practice of embedding security into your development pipeline — not bolting it on after the fact. It means security is part of the code, build, deploy, and monitor lifecycle.</p>

  <h2>Why It Matters Now</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🧠 Developers move fast — faster than security teams can keep up manually</li>
    <li>💣 Threat actors automate their attacks — so you must automate defense</li>
    <li>📦 You rely on third-party packages, services, and pipelines — all of which can be compromised</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Good DevSecOps Looks Like</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Secret scanning in CI/CD (stop hardcoded API keys)</li>
    <li>✅ Dependency scanning with Snyk, Dependabot, or Trivy</li>
    <li>✅ Linting for security misconfigurations (like misused `eval` or open CORS)</li>
    <li>✅ Production deploys require code review + security checklist</li>
    <li>✅ Real-time alerting when suspicious deploys or changes hit staging/prod</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Shift Left. Stay Ahead.</h2>
  <p>If you integrate security early, you ship faster later. Bugs are easier to fix before they hit production — and cheaper too.</p>

  <p><strong>DevSecOps isn’t the future. It’s now.</strong></p>
