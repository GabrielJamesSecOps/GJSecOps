  <h1>Why Ethical Companies Still Get Breached</h1>

  <p>Just because your company has strong values doesn’t mean your systems are secure. Good intentions don’t protect data — good practices do.</p>

  <h2>The False Sense of Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>“We care about users”</strong> – but you don’t encrypt their data at rest.</li>
    <li><strong>“We believe in transparency”</strong> – but your security logs are off.</li>
    <li><strong>“We’re doing good in the world”</strong> – but your APIs are unauthenticated.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Hackers don’t care about your mission. They care about your access, your credentials, and your vulnerabilities. They’ll hit the nonprofit as fast as they’ll hit the hedge fund.</p>

  <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Environmental orgs getting breached via public S3 buckets</li>
    <li>Healthcare startups leaking PII due to poor access controls</li>
    <li>Education platforms attacked through vendor plugins</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Align Values and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Make data privacy part of your culture and onboarding</li>
    <li>✅ Budget for security the way you budget for ethics reviews</li>
    <li>✅ Have a public disclosure policy (security.txt)</li>
    <li>✅ Treat user data like you would your own</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Being ethical means being secure — because trust without protection is just a promise waiting to be broken.</strong></p>
