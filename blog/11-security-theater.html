  <h1>Security Theater vs. Real Security: How to Tell the Difference</h1>

  <p>Just because something looks secure doesn’t mean it actually protects anything. Security theater is the illusion of security — logos, policies, and processes that make people feel safe without actually doing the work.</p>

  <h2>Examples of Security Theater</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🧾 Fancy onboarding training no one remembers</li>
    <li>📁 Security policies that exist — but no one reads or enforces</li>
    <li>🔒 “Secure” dashboards using HTTP instead of HTTPS</li>
    <li>⚠️ Checklists that are copied from competitors and never updated</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It’s a Problem</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>False confidence:</strong> People assume they’re protected when they’re not</li>
    <li><strong>Slower response time:</strong> Theater replaces real detection and reaction</li>
    <li><strong>Wasted budget:</strong> Money goes to certifications, not prevention</li>
    <li><strong>Increased liability:</strong> “We had a policy” doesn’t mean you followed it</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Real Security Looks Like</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Regular audits — and follow-ups</li>
    <li>✅ Monitored logs, with alerts and thresholds</li>
    <li>✅ Clear roles and revocable access</li>
    <li>✅ Security tools integrated into dev workflows</li>
    <li>✅ IR playbooks tested with actual scenarios</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>If no one reads the policy, it's decoration. If no one acts on the data, it’s noise. And if no one owns security, no one’s accountable.</strong></p>
